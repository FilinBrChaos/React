            use more than one anchor at a belay and rappel station. Your life depends on it. Beginner climbers are 
            most vulnerable to accidents. Always use sound judgment; respect climbing dangers; don't climb over your 
            head; find an experienced mentor or take climbing lessons from an experienced guide to learn how to climb 
            safely. Remember that most accidents happen because of climber error. Use the following 10 tips to keep safe 
            when you're out rock climbing."
